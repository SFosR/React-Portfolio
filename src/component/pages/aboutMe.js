          <p>I always thought I should be an engineer of some sort. In fact, every "career test" I've ever taken has said so.  
          After years in sales, having success but not completely loving it, So I decided to actually do something about it. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp. I'm Full Stack web developer with skills in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, MySql, React with more to come. I recently earned a certificate in 
          full stack develpment from THE Ohio State University. With a background in sales, I'm excited to bring my problem solving, independent and 
          leadership skills to create meaningful web applicatons. I'm experienced in working in a fast-paced environment, working independently and also as a team. I'm a firm believer 
          that in this ever changing world, you must constantly be learning.
