      <p>I always thought I should be an engineer of some sort. In fact, every "career test" I've ever taken has said so. So I decided to actually do something about it.  
      After years in sales, having success but not completely loving it, I enrolled in to coding bootcamp. I'mFull Stack web developer wiwth skills in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, MySql, React with more to come. Recently earned a certificate in 
      full stack develpment from THE Ohio State University. With a background in sales, I'm excited to bring my problem solving, independent and 
      leadership skills to create meaningful web applicatons. I'm experienced in working in a fast-paced environment, working independently and also as a team. I'm a firm believer 
      that in this ever changing world, you must constantly educate yourself as to the lastest techinques. </p>l
